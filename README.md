TravelAgencyWebsite
===================
This is a web application I developed for a fake travel agency. It uses Apache Tomcat as the Web server, 
and MySQL as the DB server. The other technologies used in this application are Struts and Hibernate.

TEAM 
===================
This was an individual project. I developed it during my undergraduate studies for the final project of 
Internet Engineering course. 

INSTALL
===================
Copy the whole repo into Tomcat webapps directory. Run the src/com/agency/domain/db.sql to setup the 
DB. Start the app at index.jsp!
